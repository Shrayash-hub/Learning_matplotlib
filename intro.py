# The core problem Matplotlib solves is translating abstract numerical data into an intuitive, visual format that the human brain can process instantly.

# Specifically, it solves these problems:

# Cognitive Overload: You can't hold thousands of data points in your head.

# Hidden Pattern Recognition: Relationships between variables are the foundation of machine learning.


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

y = [20, 40, 10, 70, 110]

plt.plot(x,y)
plt.show()
